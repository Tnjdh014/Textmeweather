# Textmeweather
sends a text message with the current weather information. It retrieves the weather data from an API, converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and constructs a message with the temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed.

- Accomplished building a weather notification system, as measured by successful API calls and SMS sends, by developing the send_weather_update() function in Python
- Accomplished retrieving real-time weather data, as measured by integrating the OpenWeatherMap API, by making API calls within send_weather_update()
- Accomplished formatting weather data, as measured by constructing an SMS-ready message with temperature, humidity and wind speed, by parsing the API response
- Accomplished unit conversion of meteorological data, as measured by converting Celsius values to Fahrenheit, by applying data conversion algorithms
- Accomplished SMS automation, as measured by sending scheduled weather update texts, by integrating the Twilio API into the notification system
- Accomplished coding in Python, as measured by building the weather notification feature using Python logic and syntax, by developing send_weather_update() functionality
